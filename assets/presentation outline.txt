Presentation:

What problem does your app focus on: 

	Our app lets a user search for a pet based on optional search criteria, and a required zip code. Users can add pets to their favorites, and they can contact pet listings.

	Users are stored using Firebase authentication, and data is stored using Firebase database. This allows users to access their favorites on different computers, becauase this information is associated with that user account.

	Giscard primarily focused on the UI/UX. 
	Helmut focused on the authentication and UX on the back end.
	Alex focused on database interaction, and UX on the back end.

	With use of github, we were able to collaborate and work in parallel.


Demonstration:
	SET UP - have a user with favorites already in the database


1. log in with pre-existing user, show that user's favorites with "view favorites"
2. log out, log in with invalid credentials (show authentication validation)
2.5 user stays logged in until they log out.. (show new tab and they are logged in)
3. create new user (show validation - on email and pass, show firebase users got updated, show uid in database)
4. show favorites is empty..
5. show a search (show optional/required params)
6. add to favorites.. (show that "view favorites" modal is updated, and firebase db is updated)
7. go to favorites, show we can send an email - it's pre-populated with a message, and is editable.. (change To field, and show email functionality actually works)




to do in the future..: history of emails, add pets to db based off unique id and not name, have search results dynamically update if each result is a favorite..

fb/twitter page links that work..

map..
